## What is Entity Framework?

Entity Framework is an open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for .NET applications, developed by Microsoft. It allows developers to interact with databases without focusing on the underlying tables or records in which data is stored.

## What is the Code-First approach?

In the Code-First approach, the focus is on the applicationâ€™s domain. Developers define domain entities as classes, and Entity Framework uses these classes to generate the corresponding database schema. This approach allows you to design the application logic first, rather than starting with the database design.

## What is the Database-First approach?

In the Database-First approach, you begin by designing the database. Once the database is ready, you import it into your project. Entity Framework then generates the corresponding classes and handles the mapping between the database and your code.
