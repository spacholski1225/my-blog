# My Journey to Becoming an AWS Certified Developer – Associate

Almost a year ago, I started working on a project that allowed me to practically step into the world of the cloud. My task was to create a microservice from scratch based on AWS services. Despite my previous experience, it turned out to be a challenge that quickly showed me how much more I needed to learn.

After completing the project, I wanted to continue exploring the AWS cloud, and that's why I set a goal to obtain the AWS Certified Developer – Associate (DVA-C02) certification. Long story short, I managed to pass it with a score of 820/1000.

## Project – Challenges and Lessons Learned

The implementation of the microservice gave me the opportunity to:

* Get hands-on experience with many AWS services.
* Understand how theory translates into real-world deployments.
* Solve numerous technical problems at each stage of the project.

## The Learning Process

I divided my preparation plan into three main stages:

* **Courses:** I started with intensive courses that allowed me to learn about a wide range of AWS services and understand their practical applications.
* **Flashcards:** In parallel, I created thematic flashcards that I reviewed daily. This method helped me systematically consolidate newly acquired knowledge and quickly recall key issues.
* **Practice Exams:** After consolidating my knowledge, it was time for practice tests. I focused mainly on materials from TutorialsDojo, which turned out to be very similar to the exam questions. Solving practice tests helped me get used to the exam style and identify areas requiring further work.

### Mistakes I Made

Although the initial plan was quite good, I would extend the time spent on solving practice exam questions. I solved 20-30 questions daily, which meant that towards the end of the actual exam, fatigue took its toll. The last 10-15 questions were much harder because I lacked freshness. If I could do it again, I would increase the number of daily questions to get used to a full exam session.

### Practical Tips for Future Candidates

If you are thinking about getting the AWS Associate Developer certification, here are a few tips that might be helpful:

Invest in a solid foundation: Even with prior experience, it's worth starting with courses that will solidify your knowledge.
Use flashcards: Regular review is key to consolidating material.
Practice exam tests: Familiarizing yourself with the question format and exam style will increase your confidence.
Be systematic: Divide your learning into stages and consistently implement your plan.
Prepare for the full length of the exam: Regularly solving 65 questions at once will help you avoid fatigue during the actual test.
