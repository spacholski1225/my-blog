# LLMs in IT: Beyond Code Generation

Large language models (LLMs) can analyze and understand provided materials at a level approaching human comprehension. They have wide applications not only in the IT industry. They can help with generating technical documentation and code, all the way to analyzing system data.

## Documentation Automation and Programming Support

LLMs are revolutionizing how developers work with code and documentation.

Example application:
Programming with tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor has become standard in most companies. These tools not only help generate code but allow for faster understanding and implementation of new technologies.

* **Accelerating code creation processes**
* **Simplifying documentation maintenance**
* **Enabling faster technology adoption**

## Intelligent Chatbots and IT Support

In customer service and IT support, we increasingly encounter chatbots based on LLMs. Such systems are able to:

* **Answer user questions** – analyzing requests and generating precise responses.
* **Automate ticketing processes** – redirecting more complex problems to specialists, which increases the efficiency of the support department.

## Log Analysis and Report Generation

Another area where LLMs find application is data analysis. System log analysis and report generation become increasingly complicated with the growth of data volume, but LLMs provide excellent support in this activity. LLMs can help with:

* **Processing large datasets** – analyzing logs, identifying anomaliesand suggesting potential solutions.
* **Generating reports** – based on collected data, which are useful for system administrators and security managers.
